            As the temperature cools, I am excited to pull out my sweaters and comfortably 
			wear leggings and tighter pieces without sweat clinging to them. This fall and winter,
			I am especially excited about putting the skirts I own into more use. 
			I also purchased a white, cropped and form-fitting, polo-style, collared t-shirt. I am 
			excited to layer this under my sweaters for a slightly more formal look.
		</p>
		<p>
            I will be wearing a mix of golden yellow, dark red (maroon), and green this season as 
            my accent colors. To balance them out, I'll be pairing one to two colors with other items
			that are cream white, navy, and black.
            I am drawn to outfits that have a supple and powerful temperament to themm. To me, this is 
			a mix-and-match combination between the futuristic-looking high neckline, sleek outwear, 
			sleek accessories, and sleek footwear, and long or knitted sweaters, form-fitting long 
			sleeves, vests with large arm holes, and shorter skirts that peak out where the top ends. 
            I challenge myself to wear my skirts, with hoisery or tights, and my black tight fitting
			pants! It always feels like I barely ever wear my skirts, so I'm challenging myself to 
			get more use of them this season. In particular, I am looking forward to wearing a new 
			skirt added to my closet durign the summer. It is a white skirt with a furry texture.
			I am also looking forward to wearing my jackets and coats. 
			The silhouette I will try to wear more often is the accentuated waist with defined legs or 
			arms.
