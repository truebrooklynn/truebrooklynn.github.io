        <p>Detailed top and simple bottom. </p>
        <p>There are solid, two-tone colors. One saturated, one light.
            Light colored clothing with darker, small details.
            Statement collar or halter top.
            A black long blazer vest paired with a casual t-shirt.
            A solid color with a large statement print or design.
            Clothing with sleek and structured arms. I wonder how that will work and not be hot.
