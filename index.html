  <p><span class="first-letter">Y</span>ou can call me Brooke. I like slow fashion and fast fashion. I like dark colors and light colors. I like minimalism and non-minimalism. Just when I think I've finally figured myself out--a contradiction appears! It's like this journey never ends.</p>
  <p>(Spoiler alert: this journey truly never ends)</p>
  <p>I don't have problems going out of my comfort zone--in my head. Once it gets to real life, there are things that I would LOVE to wear but...there might be no occassion for? Don't tell me the ol "you don't need to dress up for anyone other than yourself". Imagine this: someone is walking down the street in broad daylight wearing a tulle ball gown. Won't they look crazy? Will they still feel good about themselves?? I don't think so.</p>
  <p>Props to you if you feel awesome knowing other people think you look like an absolute time-travelling crazy wreck that no one wants to talk to.</p>
  <br>
  <p>This is a place for me to organize my thoughts and share my experiences. I hope you can find this helpful for your own style and fashion!<p>

  <p>xxo,</p>
