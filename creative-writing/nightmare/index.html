    <p><b>Nightmare</b></p>
    <p>Sticky clumps on the tip of my eyelids,</p>
    <p>There are trees and harsh gasps—</p>
    <p>Up and down</p>
    <p>Up and down</p>
    <p>Legs and fingers, they won’t</p>
    <p>Move.</p>
    </br>
    <p>The sky is the ceiling,</p>
    <p>The trees are the cream walls,</p>
    <p>Something soft is beneath me, and</p>
    <p>Bed sheets are where the soil used to be.</p>
    </br>
    <p>Where am I?</p>
    </br>
    <p>Eyes slowly correcting,</p>
    <p>Ceiling fan not whirling,</p>
    <p>Fingers brush soft pajamas,</p>
    <p>A moment of clarity,</p>
    </br>
    <p><i>Ah, I see,</i></p>
    </br>
    <p>We are back here again.</p>
