     <p><span class="first-letter">My handy 'fit test' checklist for the fitting room:</span></p>
 
 <div class="checkedList">
  <li style="margin-left: 5rem;"> check front view, side view, back view. <b>Are there any strange folds or cuts?</b>
  </li>
  <p></p>
  <li style="margin-left: 5rem;"> check angles: looking down from above, looking up from below. <b>Is the neckline too low? Is the bottom too short?</b>
  </li>
  <p></p>
  <li style="margin-left: 5rem;"> lift arms up and down, move around. Sit down in it. <b>Does it ride up? Is it too tight? Does it stretch out thinly? How short does it really go? Is it comfortable?</b>
  </li>
  <p></p>
  <li style="margin-left: 5rem;">
  Button it up or zip it up entirely. <b>Are there loose buttons? Does the zipper work?</b>
  </li>
  <p></p>
  <li style="margin-left: 5rem;">
  look in the mirror.
    <b>Do the hemlines fall where they should? Do undergarment lines show?</b>
  </li>
  <p></p>
  <li style="margin-left: 5rem;"> take it on and off a few times. <b>How long does it take?</b>
  </li>
  <p></p>
  <li style="margin-left: 5rem;"> walk around in it. <b>Can I wear it iwith confidence?</b>
  </li>

  <p>Over the years, I've discovered what my preferences are. It took time, wins and losses in purchases, patience, and being honest to my true self. When I pick tops off the shelves to try on, I look for...</p>

  </div>
  <p>
  <span class="first-letter">Crewnecks</span> are my favorite.
  </p>
  <p>They are so comfy and I can find them on all kinds of tops for all kinds of weather. From knit sweaters, to blouses, to t-shirts and workout wear. They are easy to find and I love the way I look in them!</p>

  <p>
  <span class="first-letter">Turtlenecks</span>  look good too.
  </p>
  <p>I only wear these in the cold, when they are on thick sweaters. I find clothing touching my neck to be extremely uncomfortable. On a thick turtleneck sweater, the neckline is less tight and doesn't bother me as much. At the same time, it keeps me warm!</p>

  <p>
  <span class="first-letter">Square necklines</span> add a lovely aura of feminity to my looks.
  </p>
  <p>I love square neckline dresses (and crewneck ones) that show a bit of my collarbone. They are more restrictive on movement and have to fit pretty snug. They also make me cold, so I look for these in summer clothing and dresses.</p>

  <span class="first-letter">About elbow-length </span> is a good length for my short sleeves.
  </p>
  <p>I look for sleeves that end at or past the middle of my upper arm, to the start of my elbow. It helps with protecting my more sensitve skin from sunburn.</p>

  <span class="first-letter">Long sleeves</span>  should end past my wrist. My wrists get cold easily otherwise. </p><p>If the sleeves are very tight and end just before my wrist, it makes the shirt look too small for me.</p>

  <span class="first-letter">Dolman sleeves</span> are my favorite.

  <p>I like these on blouses and structured sweaters. They make me feel cozy and feminine.</p>

  </div>
  <p>
  <span class="first-letter">Defined waistlines</span> make clothing look more tailored.
  </p>
  <p>I gravitate towards these when I want to look put-together. They look more slim-down and less bulky, and are less-prone to getting snagged on a hook.</p>

  <img src="https://truebrooklynn.github.io/personalstyle/fit/basic/fit_straightwaist.png" alt="Sleeves">  
  </div>
  <p>
  <span class="first-letter">Boxy, undefined waistlines</span> are my go-to when I want a more gender-neutral, masculine look.
  </p>
  <p>I wear these when I want to hide any curves or when I'm in the mood for an oversized, very casual look. This cut is also great for hot weather.</p>

  </div>
  <p>
  <span class="first-letter">Tops that end at the hip</span> are what I look best in. HOWEVER they ride up higher when I move around and get weirdly bunched up if my bottoms weren't extremely high-waisted. So they don't work with every piece of clothing I own.</p>

  <div class="oneImageInline">
  <img src="https://truebrooklynn.github.io/personalstyle/fit/basic/fit_shirtleg.png" alt="Length of top">  
  </div>
  <p>
  <span class="first-letter">Tops that end right below the bum</span> are a little safer. No matter how high they ride, they won't go above my hips. These still look fitted, and work with more items that I own.</p>

  <img src="https://truebrooklynn.github.io/personalstyle/fit/basic/fit_shirtthigh.png" alt="Length of top">  
  </div>
  <p>
  <span class="first-letter">Tops that end at mid-thigh</span> are wonderfully oversized. I love how comfortable, casual, and easy oversized tops are. The only problem is I look like I'm drowning in the shirt. 
  </p><p>So they aren't suitable for many of my everyday activities, but I love wearing them for a casual workout or to sleep :)</p>

  <p>I have a long waistline and larger thighs. One of my biggest fears is sitting, bending, or squatting and my pants falling off. My struggle has always been finding pants and skirts that fit my waist and have a high enough waist. When I pick bottoms off the shelves to try on, I look for...</p>

  <p>
  <span class="first-letter">12 inch + rises</span> on both the front and back.</p>
  <p>Especially the back. Otherwise, when I bend over, my pants slip down and I get overly self conscious. Pulling up or adjusting my pants in public is something I would rather avoid having to do.</p>

  <p>
  <span class="first-letter">A-line or Straight</span> dresses are my kinds of dresses.
  </p>
  <p>I wear ones that go past my knee, ideally end mid-way of my calf. I always wear shorts underneath with them. Of the two, I like the feel of an A-line dress better, but I go for less-flared, straight ones for more formal settings.</p>

  <p>
  <span class="first-letter">Long fitted, straight, or flared </span> pants.
  </p>
  <p>I love structured formal pants that are straight, as in they go straight down and don't curve at the bottom. There is something so cool about that particular fit. Flared jeans below the knee are super fun to wear and are for fun, casual outings. The straight, fitted pants are what I usually wear because they are the most common in the stores.</p>
