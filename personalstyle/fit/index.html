       Many of us have our favorite silhouettes and our own vision of the way
       clothing is draped to be attractive. A person's appearance and temperament 
       can change greatly based on how the clothing fits on their body. This is 
       why the fit and shape of each piece should be looked at when putting together
       the fundamental elements of their personal style.
     </p>
     <p>
       Even for people with the exact same body shapes, there is no singlular 
       'correct' way their clothes should fit. Because as individuals, they can 
       have different visions for how they want to look and what areas they desire
       to emphasize and minimize, it's important to pin down exactly what it is 
       that I wanted to look like, as well as the corresponding fit and shape
       of items that would help me achieve these looks.

       </div>
       <p>
         The first silhouette I preferred was a boxed and purposeful look.
         This was my favorite for XX occarsions and XX events. Sporting
         this silhouette always makes me feel movement, ready to go,
         ready to tackle the next problem, ready for a challenge and 
         not afraid to get sweaty and do heavy lifting.

       </div>
       <p>
         The second was the hourglass look. This is my favorite for XX occasions
         and XX events. Dressing in this silhouette tends to make me feel
         more alert and self consioucs, more shy and reserved, and formal. 
       </p>
       <p>
         For me, small arms, small waist with toned and beautifully cut muscles,
         non-provocative/non-emphasized behind, straight and sturdy legs, with airy light feet.
         I love a nice collar paired with fitted shoulders. Having a fitted waist also reduces 
         the worry of a wardrobe malfunction occuring.

       I have a long waistline and larger thighs. One of my biggest fears is sitting, bending, or squatting and my pants falling off. 
       Maybe worse: ripping. My struggle has always been finding pants and skirts that fit my waist and have a high enough waist.
       Straight and fitted silhouettes are what I wear most because they can be easily found in stores.
       I indulge a little in the loose and flared shapes when I'm relaxing or dressing things up for a fun outing.
       Over the years, after wins, losses, and reflections where I am bluntly honest to myself, 
       I've narrowed down the common aspects shared by garments I wear with success. 
       Nowadays, when I shop, I check for...
     </p>
     <p>
       The following is a list of them that I wear, these pieces can be intermingled to form one of the two silhouettes,
       hence I have not separated them out. Instead, I grouped them by what goes on top/below, and this makes for 
       more outfits and reusability since they can be mixed with each other.

       <p>
         <span class="first-letter">Crewnecks</span>
       </p>
       <p>
         Crewnecks that are fitted and stiff - these are my favorite.
         They are so comfy and I can find them on all kinds of tops for all kinds of weather. 
         From knit sweaters, to blouses, to t-shirts and workout wear. 
         They are easy to find and I love how versatile they are for layering.

       <p>
       <span class="first-letter">Turtlenecks</span>
       </p>
       <p>
         I also like to have a few turtlenecks that are less tight and good for the cold.
         I only wear these in the cold, when they are on thick sweaters. 
         Clothing touching my neck can be extremely uncomfortable. 
         With a looser neckline, they usually don't bother me and I like the way I look and feel warm in them.</p>

       <p>
       <span class="first-letter">Square necklines</span>
       </p>
       <p>
         Square necklines that are small and fit snug add a lovely aura of feminity to my looks.
         They are perfect for showing off necklaces.
         I love square neckline dresses (and crewneck ones) that show a bit of my collarbone. 
         The way the sleeves are, they restrict on movement. 
         The neckline makes the fit more fickle; if it's too low it hangs when I bend down.
         If it's too high, the shoulders don't fit right.
         It's also quiet easy to show a strap so I have to make sure I have the right undergarments to wear with these.
         They also make me cold, so I look for these in summer clothing and dresses.</p>

       </div>
       <p>
       <span class="first-letter">Elbow-length sleeves </span> or sleeves that fall at least 1/3 of the way down my forearm.
       </p>
       <p>This length helps protect my skin from the sun.</p>

       <p>
       <span class="first-letter">Long sleeves</span>  that are fitted at the wrist ends or stiff at the ends.</p>
       <p>I make sure the sleeves don't end just before my wrist; it makes the shirt look too small for me. I also make 
         sure they don't make my upper arm look squishy.</p>

       </div>
       <p>
       <span class="first-letter">Dolman sleeves</span> - these are nice when dressing down.
       </p>
       <p>I like these on structured sweaters. They make it easier to layer and hide any weird 
         lumps from fabric wrinkles on the inner layer.</p>

       </div>
       <p>
       <span class="first-letter">Fitted, defined waistlines</span>
       </p>
       <p>I gravitate towards these when I want to look put-together. They look more 
         slim-down and less bulky, and are less-prone to getting snagged on a hook.</p>

       <p>
       <span class="first-letter">Fitted, straight waistlines</span>
       </p>
       <p>I wear these when I want to hide any curves or when I'm in the mood for an oversized, 
         very casual look. This cut is also great for hot weather.</p>

       <p>
       <span class="first-letter">Tops that end at the hip</span> - these are what I look best in.</p>
       <p>They look great; not too short and not too long. 
         HOWEVER they ride up higher when I move around and get weirdly bunched up if my bottoms 
         weren't extremely high-waisted. So they don't work with every piece of clothing I own.

       </div>
       <p>
       <span class="first-letter">12 inch + rises</span> on both the front and back.</p>
       <p>Especially the back. Otherwise, when I bend over, my pants slip down and I get overly self conscious. 
         Pulling up or adjusting my pants in public is something I would rather avoid having to do.</p>

       <p>
         <span class="first-letter">Straight or A-line dresses/skirts</span>
       </p>
       <p>I wear ones that go past my knee, ideally end mid-way of my calf. 
         I always wear shorts underneath with them.
         Of the two, I like the feel of an A-line dress better, but I go for 
         less-flared, straight ones for more formal settings.</p>

       <p>
       <span class="first-letter">Straight-legged pants</span> - these are the most versatile.
       </p>
       <p>
         I love structured formal pants that are straight, as in they go straight down and don't curve at the bottom. 
         A pair of fitted and a pair of flared bottoms can be great to mix things up. 
         The straight, fitted pants are the cuts I own most because they can be easily coordinated for most occasions.

       Whenever possible, I try on products to make sure they are what I'm looking before before I make the purchase.
       Here are the key aspects that I think about when I'm trying them on:
