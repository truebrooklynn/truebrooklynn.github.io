  <p><span class="first-letter">M</span>y favorite silhouette is a mesh of the rectangle and hourglass: small arms, 
     small waist with toned and beautifully cut muscles,
     non-provocative/non-emphasized behind, straight and sturdy legs, with airy light feet.
    </p>
  <p>I love a nice collar paired with fitted shoulders. Having a fitted waist also reduces the worry of a wardrobe malfunction occuring.</p>

  <p><span class="first-letter">In the fitting room, I check...</span></p>
 
  <div class="checkedList">
    <li style="margin-left: 5rem;">The front view, side view, back view.
      </br>--------<b>Are there any strange folds or cuts?</b>
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li style="margin-left: 5rem;"> All the angles: looking down from above, looking up from below. 
      </br>--------<b>Is the neckline too low? Is the bottom too short?</b>
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li style="margin-left: 5rem;"> The movement range. Move the arms, squat, sit, jump. 
      </br>--------<b>Does it ride up? Is it too tight? Does it stretch out thinly? How short does it really go? Is it comfortable?</b>
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li style="margin-left: 5rem;">The hardware.
      </br>--------<b>Are there loose buttons? Do the zippers work?</b>
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li style="margin-left: 5rem;">The draping.
      </br>--------<b>Do the hemlines fall where they should? Do undergarment lines show?</b>
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li style="margin-left: 5rem;"> The ease of wear.
      </br>--------<b>How long does it take to put it on and take it off? Can I manage by myself or do I need help?</b>
    </li>
    <p></p>
    <li style="margin-left: 5rem;"> My headspace.
      </br>--------<b>Can I walk out wearing it iwith confidence?</b>

  <p>Over the years, after wins, losses, and reflections where I am bluntly honest to myself, 
    I've narrowed down the common aspects shared by garments I wear with success. 
    Nowadays, when I shop, I check for...</p>

  <div class="oneImageInline">
  <img src="fit_crewneck.png" alt="Doodle of a fitted crewneck">  
  </div>
  <p>
  <span class="first-letter">Crewnecks</span> that are fitted and stiff - these are my favorite.
  </p>
  <p>They are so comfy and I can find them on all kinds of tops for all kinds of weather. 
    From knit sweaters, to blouses, to t-shirts and workout wear. 
    They are easy to find and I love how versatile they are for layering.</p>
  <p></p>

  <div class="someContentBanner"> 
  <div class="oneImageInline">
  <img src="fit_turtleneck.png" alt="Doodle of a turtleneck neckline">  
  </div>
  <p>
  <span class="first-letter">Turtlenecks</span> that are less tight and good for the cold.
  </p>
  <p>I only wear these in the cold, when they are on thick sweaters. 
    Clothing touching my neck can be extremely uncomfortable. 
    With a looser neckline, they usually don't bother me and I like the way I look and feel warm in them.</p>
  <p></p>

  <div class="someContentBanner"> 
  <div class="oneImageInline">
  <img src="fit_squareneck.png" alt="Doodle of a squareneck neckline">  
  </div>
  <p>
  <span class="first-letter">Square necklines</span> that are small and fit snug - these add a lovely aura of feminity to my looks.
  </p>
  <p>I love square neckline dresses (and crewneck ones) that show a bit of my collarbone. 
    The way the sleeves are, they restrict on movement. 
    The neckline makes the fit more fickle; if it's too low it hangs when I bend down.
    If it's too high, the shoulders don't fit right.
    It's also quiet easy to show a strap so I have to make sure I have the right undergarments to wear with these.
    They also make me cold, so I look for these in summer clothing and dresses.</p>

  <div class="oneImageInline">
  <img src="fit_sleeveshort.png" alt="Doodle of an elbow-length sleeve">  
  </div>
  <p>
  <span class="first-letter">Elbow-length sleeves </span> or sleeves that fall at least 1/3 of the way down my forearm.
  </p>
  <p>This length helps protect my skin from the sun.</p>

  <div class="oneImageInline">
  <img src="fit_sleevelong.png" alt="Doodle of a long sleeve">  
  </div>
  <p>
  <span class="first-letter">Long sleeves</span>  that are fitted at the wrist ends or stiff at the ends.</p>
  <p>I make sure the sleeves don't end just before my wrist; it makes the shirt look too small for me. I also make sure they don't make my upper arm look squishy.</p>

  <img src="fit_sleevedolman.png" alt="Doodle of a doberman sleeve, wider at the elbow and lower forearm.">  
  </div>
  <p>
  <span class="first-letter">Dolman sleeves</span> - these are nice when dressing down.
  </p>
  <p>I like these on structured sweaters. They make it easier to layer and hide any weird lumps from fabric wrinkles on the inner layer.</p>

  <div class="someContentBanner"> 
  <div class="oneImageInline">
  <img src="fit_definedwaist.png" alt="Doodle of a defined waist fabric fit">
  </div>
  <p>
  <span class="first-letter">Fitted, defined waistlines</span>
  </p>
  <p>I gravitate towards these when I want to look put-together. They look more slim-down and less bulky, and are less-prone to getting snagged on a hook.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="someContentBanner"> 
  <div class="oneImageInline">
  <img src="fit_straightwaist.png" alt="Doodle of a fabric that fits straight down">  
  </div>
  <p>
  <span class="first-letter">Fitted, straight waistlines</span>
  </p>
  <p>I wear these when I want to hide any curves or when I'm in the mood for an oversized, very casual look. This cut is also great for hot weather.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="someContentBanner"> 
  <div class="oneImageInline">
  <img src="fit_shirthip.png" alt="Doodle of a top that fits at the hip">  
  </div>
  <p>
  <span class="first-letter">Tops that end at the hip</span> - these are what I look best in.</p>
  <p>They look great; not too short and not too long. 
    HOWEVER they ride up higher when I move around and get weirdly bunched up if my bottoms weren't extremely high-waisted. 
    So they don't work with every piece of clothing I own.</p>
  <p></p>

  <div class="someContentBanner"> 
  <div class="oneImageInline">
  <img src="fit_bottomwaist.png" alt="Doodle of waistband rise of bottoms">  
  </div>
  <p>
  <span class="first-letter">12 inch + rises</span> on both the front and back.</p>
  <p>Especially the back. Otherwise, when I bend over, my pants slip down and I get overly self conscious. 
    Pulling up or adjusting my pants in public is something I would rather avoid having to do.</p>

  <img src="fit_dress.png" alt="Tops">  
  </div>
  <p>
  <span class="first-letter">Straight or A-line dresses/skirts</span>
  </p>
  <p>I wear ones that go past my knee, ideally end mid-way of my calf. 
    I always wear shorts underneath with them.
    Of the two, I like the feel of an A-line dress better, but I go for less-flared, straight ones for more formal settings.</p>

  <p>
  <span class="first-letter">Straight-legged pants</span> - these are the most versatile.
  </p>
  <p>I love structured formal pants that are straight, as in they go straight down and don't curve at the bottom. 
    A pair of fitted and a pair of flared bottoms can be great to mix things up. 
    The straight, fitted pants are the cuts I own most because they can be easily coordinated for most occasions.</p>

  <div class="someContentBanner"> 
  <p>I have a long waistline and larger thighs. One of my biggest fears is sitting, bending, or squatting and my pants falling off. 
    Maybe worse: ripping. My struggle has always been finding pants and skirts that fit my waist and have a high enough waist.
    Straight and fitted silhouettes are what I wear most because they can be easily found in stores.
    I indulge a little in the loose and flared shapes when I'm relaxing or dressing things up for a fun outing.</p>
