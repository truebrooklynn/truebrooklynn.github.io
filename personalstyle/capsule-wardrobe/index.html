		<span class="first-letter">A</span> capsule wardrobe is small. Mine was not created out of desire. 
    The main reason I have one is: not enough space. After moving into a studio apartment for rent taught me two things:
  </p>
  <p>
    1. I don't have space for a large set of clothes
  </p>
  <p>
    2. Having many clothes will make my next move even more of a headache.
  </p>
  <p>
    Minimizing the amount of clothing I have while still always having something to wear for the right occasion is tough.
    There are multiple occasions I dress up for: casual for everyday errands (I am not doing groceries in a fancy shirt and shoes), chores, sleeping, working out, 
    dressy for nights out and grabbing food with friends, and formal for the professional environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    The other requirement is my wardrobe should work for fluctuating temperatures. There are 4 seasons where I live, with summers seeing up to 40 degrees celsius,
    and winters can be down to -30 degrees celsius. There's all kinds of precipitation: rain and snow. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, being environmentally conscious to me includes reducing the use of electricity and water. This means I am not doing laundry every other day.
    There should be enough clothes to wear until my next laundry day.

  <p>My capsule wardrobe was not borne from an aspiration for the minimalistic lifestyle. It did not come from a wish to wear all neutral colors either.
  It came from the constraints of reality. It's a necessity. 
  It's life.</p>

	</p>
	<p>
		Treating your environment right = treating yourself right!
	</p>
	<p>
		Love what you have! Fall in love with the things you know. Really get to know them: how to care for them,
		how they fit on you, what colors and shapes go well with them. Then use them. You bought them for a reason:
		they fit you, they are amazing, go and wear them.
		This is tricky in times of online shopping, however I have to say, the best is to try on before you buy
		and make sure it's comfortable and fits you right before you do the purchase.
		Finally, thrift - reuse before buying new. It's not embarrassing to thrift or wear second-hand, I promise!
