    best thing within your budget.

  <p>
    What are you going to wear with it?
    If it's too large: it will be hard to layer and fit under a coat
    If it's too figure hugging or has distress: can you wear it for multiple occasions?
    Is it in your color scheme and do you have things to match with it already, or will you need to buy even more?
    Knits can be higher maintenance and harder to sanitize or clean.
    Can it be machine washed?
  </p>
  <p>
    How many uses do you plan to get out of it? Do you own something already that could be used for the same purpose?
  </p>
  <p>
    How long will you love it?
    Is it a spur of the moment, or do you actually like it?
    Do you already own something similar in function or style? If so, is there a good reason for acquiring another one?
    Finally, do you know how to dispose of it correctly?
  </p>
  <p>
    And of course, is it within your budget Never break the bank for a purchase!
