		<span class="first-letter">Things to Consider Before Making the Purchase</span>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<b>1. Longevity: </b>Estimate how long the shape, color, and fabric will last before it starts to wear out.
		<ul>
			How long will you love it?
		</ul>
		<ul>
			Is it a spur of the moment, or do you actually like it?
		</ul>
		<ul>
			Finally, can you know how to dispose of it correctly?
		</ul>		
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<b>2. Purpose: </b>Consider whether the item will be put to good use.
		<ul>
			How many uses do you plan to get out of it? 
		</ul>
		<ul>
			Do you own something already that could be used for the same purpose?
		</ul>
		<ul>
			Do you already own something similar in function or style? If so, is there a good reason for acquiring another one?
		</ul>		
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<b>3. Living with it: </b>Consider how the item will be worn and maintained throughout its lifespan.
		<ul>
			What are you going to wear with it?
			<ul>
				- If it's too large: it will be hard to layer and fit under a coat
			</ul>
			<ul>
				- If it's too figure hugging or has distress: can you wear it for multiple occasions?
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			Is it in your color scheme and do you have things to match with it already, or will you need to buy even more?
		</ul>
		<ul>
			Knits can be higher maintenance and harder to sanitize or clean.
			Can it be machine washed?
		</ul>		
	</ul>

		<span class="first-letter">Tips for Spending Smart</span>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<ul>
			Do research and soak in the information from the surrounding groups of people, media, and more, to identify
			what you are really looking for or what you truly want. 
		</ul>
		<ul>
			Know the market: what the the best stores, when are the good sales, and what are the prices like, to know where 
			to purchase it from and the right time to make the purchase.
		</ul>
		<li>
			Have options and evaluate them against your goals, personal style, and budget.
		</li>
		<li>
			If possible, see it in person first. This allows you to try it on, test the fit, and see what the color and fabric 
			look like in person.
		</li>
		<li>
			Make sure it is within your budget. I don't recommend breaking the bank for a clothing purchase!
		</li>

	<p>
		<span class="first-letter">Other Recommendations</span>
	</p>
	<ul>
		Love what you have! Fall in love with the things you know. Really get to know them: how to care for them,
		how they fit on you, what colors and shapes go well with them. Then use them. You bought them for a reason:
		they fit you, they are amazing, go and wear them.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		The best is to try on before you buy and make sure it's comfortable and fits you right before you go through with
			the purchase. This is tricky in times of online shopping.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Mend, sew, and thrift - reuse before buying new. It's not embarrassing to thrift or wear second-hand, I promise!  
	</ul>
	<ul>
		Finally, when gift shopping, consider that the best present is something they want, but they won't get for themselves. Get them the 
		best thing within your budget.
	</ul>
