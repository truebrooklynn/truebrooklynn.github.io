		A capsule closet is a set of distinct, versatile clothing items and accessory pieces,
		selected such thtat they can be coordinated and combined in countless, much loved ways. Such collections can be 
		solutions to storage space limitations, choice overload (i.e. feeling overwhelmed by the number of options to 
		choose from), and budget constraints.

		I have a variety of clothing pieces and footwear for casual to formal events and all kinds of weather.
		Each season, I prefer organizing a set of small groups of clothing pieces that suite the weather patterns
		of the season, the styles and colors I have the most interest in, and the activities and events that I plan to be part of.
		I call these my mini capsule closets.

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Get Familiarized with what I owned and discover gaps in the closet through creating and updating the capsule closet.
		</li>
		<li>
			Gain a deeper understanding to my own dress and spending habits by reflecting on the items that are worn more often
			and comparing with the items that I tend to gravitate towards purchasing or own the most of.
		</li>
		<li>
			Identify areas of improvment to curate a more personalized fashion that better empowers self-expression in the way
			that I want.
		</li>
		<li>
			Save on storage space and improve organization by minimizing the amount of items that are in the closet. Items 
			not in use can be put away or, if they will be no longer worn, repurposed.
		</li>
		<li>
			Discover new combinations through challenging my creativity to work with what I have. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Avoiding unnecessary duplicate purchases and save money by having a better understanding of what I already own.

		<span class="first-letter">My Methodology for Building a Mini Capsule</span>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			1. Identify the main purpose or the motivation for a capsule closet.
			<p>
				We often identify a purpose when we recognize the desire to do something. In the same way, when we find interest in 
				using a capsule closet, it is important to recognize the gap that we are trying to fill. My motivation was not borne 
				from an aspiration to be "trendy" or a wish to be "minimalistically timeless". 
			</p>
			<ul>
				Moving into a studio apartment taught me two things:
				<ul>
					- There was not enough space for a large set of clothes, and
				</ul>
				<ul>
					- As I was renting, having many clothes would make my next move even more of a headache.
					The more things we have, it will require a longer time and more space in order to pack, move, and settle in.
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<p>
				My main purpose was to achieve two things: use space efficiently and reduce the amount of packing and unpacking
				needed when I moved next.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			2. List out the "must haves", i.e. the factors that constrain what items that can be reduced from the closet.
			<p>
				Why not just have less clothes?
			</p>
			<p>
				Simply minimizing the amount of clothing we have would backfire for many. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Personally, if I reduced my wardrobe to 30 items, I would not have the clothing I needed for 
				all my different activities. I wore casual clothes for everyday errands, chores, exercise, and sleep (I was not
				planning to vacuum and clean in fancy clothes and shoes), albeit more dressed up for nights out and trips,
				and formal for any professional activities. Moreover, I needed a variety of clothing as the weather and temperature 
				fluctuated greately. Summers could feel as hot as 40 degrees celsius, and winters could be as cold as -30 degrees celsius. 
				There could be all kinds of precipitation, including rain, snow, and hail. Finally, as I was keeping my use of 
				electricity and water low to be environmentally conscious, I was not doing laundry every other day. This meant that I 
				needed to have enough clothes to last wearing until the next time I did laundry.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			3. Evaluate the current collection against the fundamentals of our personal style (color palette, fit, and fabric).
			Identify what works and what doesn't.
		</li>
		<li>
			4. Decide whether items should be kept and worn, stored away and worn later, or if it will no longer be worn.
			Have a repurpose pile for any items that can be re-purposed.
		</li>
		<li>
			5. Repeat 3 and 4 until all items are sorted out.
		</li>
	</ul>

	</p>
	<p>
		Periodicallly, new cycles will come in (be it a new season, a move, or any change in life that makes us need or want to 
		pack away some pieces and make changes to our wardrobe). Usually, this is the right time to review and identify any
		shortcomings and strong points to capitalize on.
	</p>
	<p>
		Below are questions I ask myself when reflecting.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			What were my expectations at the start?
			<ul>
				How did I envision using this collection?
			</ul>
			<ul>
				What outfits did I think I would wear?
			</ul>
			<ul>
				Which pieces were my favorite? Which ones did I feel apprehensive or had doubts about?
			</ul>
			<ul>
				Were there any pieces that I wanted to get the most use out of?
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			In reality, how did this capsule measure up to my expectations?
			<ul>
				Was there anything unexpected that happened?
			</ul>
			<ul>
				Was I able to manage with this set, or did I switch out any items?
			</ul>
			<ul>
				What was the most used and least used item? Similarly, what was the item with lowest 
				cost per wear and the item with highest cost per wear?
			</ul>
			<ul>
				Was there any purchases I made during this time? If yes, how did it 
				change my capsule after it was added?
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

		As I worked through the process of curating my capsule closets, I started to learn more about how I liked to dress,
		my habits, and my weaknesses. My capsule closet became much more tailored towards my personality and the way I 
		wanted to express myself. Every capsule was unique; they changed through each cycle along with changes to my 
		perception, my lifestyle, and the influences from the media and community around me. I like to journal and 
		track my capsules to be able to step back and see how my style changes and grows in parrallel to my life.
