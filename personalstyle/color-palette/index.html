     In my teenage years, I was introduced to the concept of wearing colors based on the tone of 
     my hair, eyes, and skin. Prior, I just wore my favorite colors.

       I use to think that wearing White was for people who were afraid of dirt,
       silver or gold were for those who desired to be treated as though
       they were rich, neon pink was for those who wanted to be seen by 
       virtually anyone and everyone, and wearing multiple neon colors 
       side-by-side were for people like Picasso paintings; highly 
       admired and difficult to understand. A fully black outfit were worn by 
       people who wanted to be scary or wanted to be scary and be a ninja at the same time.
     </p>
     <p>
       I have since made peace with most of these beliefs. I still feel self-conscious looking at
       gold and silver colored hardware and I avoid white colored bottoms no matter how 
       "elegant" it may look. I am quite prone to grime and stains, especially when in the city.
       Wearing white can stress me out, distracting me from other, more important, tasks, by having
       to divert part of my attention towards my clothing. White also stains easily, such as when
       rubbed against a blue jean. Another stressor is neon colored clothing, which is harsh on
       my eyes and bleeds color easily in the wash. Black is one of my go-tos now when I want
       something that hides dirt and grit as I move around. However, black takes time and effort 
       to find the right piece of the right fit and material to avoid looking tacky.

     Skin Undertone is a label I despise, but it's used everywhere: makeup blogs, beauty quizzes,
     magazines... they all use it as a basis for what you should be wearing. I despised the label
     for my skin. Yellow.
   </p>
   <p>
     Historically, yellow was a racially offensive term used to refer to someone by their skin color.
     Yellow was used as a skin label to insult and cause harm to people with tan skin, with the 
     connotation that 'yellow' people were dirty and beneath white skinned, and that they were
     malnourished and sickly. It's an extremely rude, discriminatory, and unacceptable way of calling
     someone, and unfortunately it still can be heard as being used in a derogatory way today.
     This is why the connotation behind calling anyone's skin as "yellow" undertone makes me uncomfortable.

         Pink was fine; it's uncommon to use pink to depict someone's skin in a racially discriminatory way -- however, my undertone was not pink.
       </p>
       <p>
         I remember going into a makeup store with my friend and watching her swatch lipstick. 
         At one point, she said a particular bottle of foundation would suite me because I was a yellow undertone like her. 
         The color of my veins, more green than of blue, decided that my skin undertone yellow.
         But I was not happy with this conclusion. Yellow skin was such a horrid way of describing anyone.
         I wanted to be called something else.
       </p>
       <p> 
         When the concept of "olive undertone" came out, I was excited.
         The label olive, to me, was fairly neutral. Like pink, it's uncommon to hear the word "olive" in racist phrases.
         Olive was supposedly not pink nor yellow, but "in between", whatever that meant. 
         It was fantastically vague and I thought I could make this new label work for me.
         However, when I got to the recommended colors section for the olive undertone, I was out.
       </p>
       <p>In the end... my friend was right about my undertone.
         And later, I learned to look past the label of my skintone, and appreciate it for what it was.
       </p>
       <p style="text-align:center"><span class="first-letter"><b>"Warm colors look good on you."</b></span></p>
       <p>Something clicked into place when I heard this comment. Why use skin color as a label? Why not use the actual colors as a label instead?
         At the end of the day, it's about finding the right color for me. And that was my takeaway.
         Regardless of skin color, it's about what looks good. It has to make you feel special, warm, and lovely.</p>

       <p>Today, I say that warm colors look good on me. And they do.</p>
       <p>Is my closet full of warm colors only? Not at all! Maybe someday?</p>

     The color palette in my wardrobe. The top row, from order of left to right, they are: accent colors, which are
     golden yellow, red, orange, navy blue, and forest green. The bottom row are the base colors: beige, tan, 
     cream white, black, and grey.
   </p>
   <p>
      These are the colors of my palette because I look energetic & feel confident when wearing them.
      Furthermore, I can easily pair multiple colors in this palette with each other.
   </p>
   <p>
     Regardless of my skin, my intent for my color palette was to make my favorite 
     features stand out and really pop. For me, these were my eyes and hair. 
     Warm colors that were saturated and erred on the side of a darker shade, did the job. To tone down
     the harshness on the eyes, I picked up my favorite neutral colors to act as a base. These neutral
     colors give the colors I love some balance and space to breathe.

     There are a multitude of warm colors and every color has its 'warm' variation to it--however,
      not every warm color made me feel good in it. I decided to narrow down these colors further
     and eliminate the ones that did not have my confidence--afterall, why purchase items in colors
     that I would not be happy wearing?

         A person's level of confidence sets the tone for the day. It can even make or break a deal.
         That's why it's important to feel comfortable looking in the mirror before going out. 
         However, putting a color on trial to decide whether it gets to stay in an efficient,
         high-performing, and long-term wardrobe, can be strangely uncomfortable. It makes a person
         question themselves on external influences, fairness, and whether they are making the right
         decision.
       </p>
       <p>
         This process of elimination should get real personal. It takes a lot of honest judgement inwards.
         If you don't know what you're expressing with the colors you wear, if you don't think the colors 
         suit who you are, well...The reflection in the mirror will confuse not only you, but your audience as well.
         Most people have experienced being distracted from a decent presentation by a puzzling choice 
         of wardrobe, resulting in having to struggle to keep their eyes on the key message.
       </p>
       <p style="text-align:center">

       <p>
         The reason this process may be uncomfortable is that the evaluation is usually highly opinion-based,
          and there might not be a consensus. For instance, let's take a look at a Picasso-styled doodle.
          It's abstract, warped shaped, and full of different colors. It's busy and loud, and personally, 
          I detest looking at it. In my eyes, it has no focus, no direction, and it's scattered everywhere. 
          It gives off a lost, unhappy vibe. You might disagree, and that is normal and expected. 
       </p>
       <div class="oneImage">

       <p>
         Feeling good in a color is like your taste in art. It's subjective and entirely about you. 
         There is no definite right or wrong. You could detest a piece of art but acknowledge 
         that it is a masterpiece. It's the same with color choice. You can recognize that a color 
         looks great on someone, but hate wearing it yourself.
         The key is being conscious of what colors you will and will not wear. It saves wasteful purchases.
         You could try to be more objective when evaluating a piece by separating the color of the item from 
         its shape and other features, such as cutting out a square hole then looking at only the item's color 
         through the opening to make sure you are looking at its color and not anything else, such as its shape.

     Finally, I revisited my color palette to add or subtract colors that did and did not fit with my lifestyle.
     I narrowed down to only warm colors that I would actually wear and noted down the tricky colors that 
     I am tempted to buy but never actually wear, just to help with preventing myself from coming back with 
     a purchase that I regret after a month.

         Some of you here may not like to be practical. You may feel it stifles your creativity.
         You can't escape the fact that there are certain colors that just aren't appropriate for 
         certain activities. For example, an orange pair of slacks to work is going to make a statement. 
         A white t-shirt while gardening will get visibly soiled. I live in a large city with lots of 
         traffic and lots of grime. There are crowds and cars and strong winds from the airflow around 
         skyscrapers. I also don't do laundry every day and try my best to conserve energy and clean water.
         This means chosing outerwear, bottoms, and shoes that are wearable and don't easily soil.
         This also means that as much as a full, light-color suite or outfit looks amazing, 
         I cannot have them.
       </p>
       <p>I personally avoid wearing these colors. Something always feels off when I see myself in them. </p>
       <ul style="margin-left: 5rem;">

         <li style="color:purple;"><b>saturated purple</b></li>
       </ul>
     </div>
   </details>

   <p>
     During my assessment, I considered picking colors that work for multiple occassions, 
     that can be easily coordinated, and require minimal upkeep.

     Sticking to my color palette helps me maintain a cohesive wardrobe. It's easier to put
     together matching outfits that I want to wear. I try my best to optimize, optimize, optimize!
     Each piece must be worn, no one is left collecting dust. Making good use of my money is 
     important to me; cross-checking with my palette helps me ground the spontaneous energy I get 
     when I walk past store displays and sales.
