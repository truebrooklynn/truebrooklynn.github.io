		<span class="first-letter">H</span>ave you ever bought a shirt only to watch it stretch longer and longer the more you wear it?
		Have you ever worn jeans that develop ripples in the fabric after a few washes?
		Or maybe you've seen a cute, airy skirt, only to look from the back - yikes, the underwear line is showing.
		The magic is in the fabric.
		Read the fabric label.
		Read the wash label.
		Touch it with your hands.

	<p>When the fabric doesn't meet your lifestyle, turn away.</p>

  Fabric makes a big impact on how the item looks. Softer fabrics easily shape to their wearer.
  They move and flow with the wearer and get easily affected by environment factors, such as friction and wind.
  Stiffer, thicker fabrics hold their shape and fly up less easily in the wind. They are typically more durable.
  However, they are less forgiving in fit; trying before you buy is a must.</p>

  <p>Pay attention to textures on fabric. A softer texture softens the vibe. A harder, plastic texture gives a more jaded, strict vibe.
	Add-ons, such as embroidery and sequins, could mean the garment cannot go into the washing machine and must be hand washed.
	Certain textures can irritate the skin and turn it red.
	Finally, some fabrics can pill easily, especially if it's coming in contact with a bag.

	<p>I stick with stiff, heavy, and thick fabrics for bottoms. I wear jeans with 98%-100% cotton.
	I prefer stiff, thick tops as well, preferably breathable. My tops must be light.
	Heavy fabrics such as thick wool cause pain in my shoulders and back after a while of wearing them.</p>

	<p>For function, I stay away from fabrics that pill easily, fabrics that cannot be machine-washed on delicate, and sheer/see through
		fabrics including those that show undergarment lines. Hence my preference for 'thicker' garments. The easiest test
		is rubbing the cloth between my fingers to gauge how thick it is.
	</p>

	<p>Knits make everything look bigger, so I save those for where I want to accentuate. For outerwear, I look for
		fabrics that can be easily cleaned and won't rip easily. I test how warm they are by sticking my hand in the sleeve.
		I prefer the non-logo canvases and typically avoid prominent logo branding.
		I also look for matching buttons, no-show zippers, durable fabric, and breathable undergarments.
		Finally, I consider safety, including whether the fabric is safe on my skin, and won't get caught in anything such as a hook or velcro.
