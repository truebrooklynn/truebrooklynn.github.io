			A look has three parts: the hair, the outfit, and the accessories. 
			To create an intentional look, all three aspects should piece together to form one cohesive image.
			Across all my outfits, regardless of the occassion, the common impression I strive for is neat and ready
			to get things done. I want to look and feel cute, clean, and comfortable.
			I avoid the opposite spectrum, which is lavish, restricted, and overly decorated.

			<p><span class="first-letter">The Hair</span></p>
			<p>
				My favorite haircut is very thin front bangs with curtain side bangs that end around the mouth and 
				long straight hair with no waves, layers, nor highlights.
				Here are my three go-to hairstyles. I don't use product aside from shampoo and conditioner, so any other style 
				becomes a tragic mess in the wind.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Style 1: The easy look: a low ponytail, with wisps of bangs showing.
				</li>
				<li>
					Style 2: Brushed out: first, I comb my hair the night before it dries, to tone down the frizz. 
					The next day, my hair is left down or half-up in a claw clip or elastic band.
				</li>
				<li>
					Style 3: Hat day: Two side braids, two low buns, two half side braid and half pig tails, or a long bubble braid.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p><span class="first-letter">The Outfit</span></p>
			<p>
				Before I get dressed, I check the weather forecast and my itenary plans for the day. 
				I envision myself going through my activities for the day,
				 decide on the temperament that I want to express for the day,
				 and select my clothing pieces accordingly.
				I coordinate my clothing pieces and footwear based off of these four personal go-to categories of style. 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Style 1: The workout or lounge wear look: A T-shirt, long sleevve shirt, or sweater, pair of shorts or sweatpants,
					and slippers or runners.
				</li>
				<li>
					Style 2: The (semi) casual look: A T-shirt, long sleeve shirt, or sweater and jeans. Boots, sneakers or runners to dress
					up or down.
					Use the same color, potentially different shades, for a monochromatic look, or use two colors, two shades and one color
					for a more cozy look.
				</li>
				<li>
					Style 3: The (semi) formal look: A blouse over a tank top or t-shirt with a sweater or formal jacket on top for cool temperatures.
					A pair of slacks for a formal look or jeans for a dressed-down look.
					Heeled boots, flats, or sneakers to dress more up or down.
				</li>
				<li>
					Style 4: A dressy look: A dress or a skirt with a top and any kind of shoe to dress it up or down.
					Wear lighter colors for the day, darker colors for the night.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p><span class="first-letter">The Accessories</span></p>
			<p>
				Finally, I select my accessories based on functionality and their frequencies of wear.
				I own many accessories and try to rotate them so that they all get use and wear. 
				I select ones that will contain the items I need to have with me for the day, then any that give
				an extra touch to the outfit and completes it the way I want.
				I prefer warm tones, but own some cool tone pieces, so I can decide whether to mix them or stick to just one
				for a more traditional look. I select them such that they create either a monochrome look,
				an "in-the-same-color-different-shade" look, or a contrasting look when paired with my outfit. 
				I double check that the accessories are in good condition, double check any official and conventional 
				dress codes, and tend to save more glitzy pieces for the evening. 
				Here are the levels of accessories I wear. 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Level 0: No accessories
				</li>
				<li>
					Level 1: Just a bag. Possibly sunglasses or a hat for the sun.
				</li>
				<li>
					Level 2: A bag with either gloves, a watch, or a bracelet
				</li>
				<li>
					Level 3: A bag, and anything on the hand or wrist.
				</li>
				<li>
					Level 4: A bag, something on the hand or wrist, and a scarf or a necklace.
				</li>
				<li>
					Level 5: A bag, something on the hand or wrist, a scarf or a necklace, and a decorative belt.
				</li>
			</ul>
