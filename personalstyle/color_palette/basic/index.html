  <p><span class="first-letter">I</span> was first introduced to the concept of matching a color to my physical look in my teenage years. Before that, I thought the colors that a person wears depended on its practicality and that individual's thoughts.</p>
</div>
<div class="someContentBanner">
  <p>White meant getting dirty. </p>
  <p>Silver or gold meant you were obsessed with money and looking rich.</p>
  <p>Hot pink meant not only were you super feminine, you were bold and lit up the crowd like: "Look here, here's some hot stuff!"</p>
  <p>Neon colors meant you were like Picasso: highly priced, admired, and hard to understand.</p>
  <p>Any sort of animal print meant you were playing dress-up because you didn't like being a human.</p>
  <p>A full black attire that was tight meant you wanted to be a ninja. A full black attire that draped meant you were shrouded in gloom.</p>

  <p>I've made peace with some of these beliefs. I cannot say whether I should be proud of myself or not--I find typically when we "grow up" we lose some of the weird perceptions we had as a child. Others, however, stick.</p>
  <p>I feel very self-conscious when I purchase something that is in a gold or silver color. Isn't that crazy? It could be sterling silver or plasic and I'd still feel self conscious buying it. Jewelry and chains are one of the few things that I would wear that are gold or silver in color.</p>
  <p>White is still a color I associate with dirt. I only ever consider white when I'm buying things that go on the upper half of my body--even then, I've owned white t-shirts and they just...are not great. I check them for stains (food, dirt, sweat) constantly and it annoys me. So. Much. I love that a white shirt (collared or no) goes so easily with other colors. I also love how a white collared shirt can usually make me look a bit more put together no matter what. It's so hard to take care of, though.</p>
  <p>Hot pink is a color that I see now as bold and fierce. I love hot pink sports bras and atheletic outerwear.</p>
  <p>Neon colors are also colors that I love now. I would definitely buy sports gear in a neon green. It's also a great color for rain gear or something that you want to be wearing when there's low visibility outdoors. However, because neon doesn't fit quite well with a "casual, blend-in" or "formal" vibe, I don't own many in my closet.</p>
  <p>Animal print is still not my thing. It's hard to find in the first place (unless if it's trending that season). I just don't own any and I don't find myself gravitating towards it. I love it on other people though.</p>
  <p>What about black? Black is my best friend, especially for bottoms and accessories. I have large legs and black helps slim it down a tiny, *tiny* bit. A black hat makes the hat less obvious when I wear it (I have black hair), which is something I love. Black gloves make dirt and grit less obvious...although if you are very keen on keeping clean, you might not like this.</p>

  <p>Now.</p>
</div>

<div class="someContentBanner">
  <p>Today, the formula I use to decide whether a color is in my color palette or not is:</br>
  <b> (skin tone AND confidence AND practical) - ( biases OR nemesis colors)</b></p>
</div>

<div class="someContentBanner">
  <p><b>Skin Tone</b></p>
  <p>Skin tone is...what my skin is. Is it pink? Is it yellow? Is it grey?</br>
  If you're like me, you probably...already somewhat have an idea of what your skin tone is.</br>
  I knew what my skin tone was based on all the clothes that I wore as a child. I gravitated to a lot of warm colors and didn't like how pale, pastel blues and greys looked on me. I loved reds and pinks and purples. MAybe it was a girl thing?</br>
  I am, through and though, a yellow undertone kind of person.</br>
  However, I hated putting a label on the kind of undertone I was. I still do, to an extent.</br></p>
</div>

<div class="someContentBanner">
  <p>In my teen years, I was in denial that I was a so-called "yellow undertone". I hated the name of it. </br>
  I remember going into a makeup store with my friend. She was trying on foundation and lipstick while I just followed her around like her tail. At one point, she started talking about how this foundation would suite me because I'm a yellow undertone like her and I said "...yellow undertone? How do you know that?"</br>
  She said because my veins looked green, not blue. I looked down at my wrist where there were swatches of lipstick and thought "uhh, I have blue veins too". We didn't buy anything that day.</br>
  When the concept of "olive" came out, I was excited. "Olive" sounded so much more special than "yellow". When I looked at the description of olive, I was so confused. "Not pink or yellow undertone". "In between". It was fantastically vague. I was even more confused. When I got to the colors suggested for an olive undertone, I hated them. I was out.</br>
  The moral of the story was: my friend was right. And so was my mom.</br>
  I'm very lucky. I grew up with a mom who I love and look up to. When I was a kid, I loved her sense of style. I look up to my mom so much, although we don't always agree.</br>
  Me and my mom, we are very different in terms of how we look and in terms of our temperament. My mom is very good at buying clothes that suite a particular person, instead of giving everyone one universal style. Unfortunately, as much as I love my mom's style, I cannot follow hers. We are really not the same. Something that looks great on me could look bad on her and vice-versa.</br>
  When I was still partially in denial of having a yellow undertone because of how un-special and ugly it sounded, I had this conversation with my mother.</br>
  "Mom," I said, "Did you know that there's this thing where a color tone is suppose to help you find out what colors you should wear?"</br>
  My mother looked at me and said, <b>"Warm colors look good on you."</b></br>
  I was so happy. I loved, loved that description.</br>
  It's not "you look good in x color".</br>
  Instead, "x color looks good on you".</br>
  This way of thinking is so special because it makes it about you. It's about what looks good on you. It makes you special and warm and lovely. Best of all? It doesn't limit you.</br></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Today, I believe that warm colors look good on me. And they do.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Is my closet full of warm colors only?</p>
  <p>Nope! (maybe someday, though?)</p>
</div>

<div class="someContentBanner">
  <p><b>Confidence</b></br>
  Confidence is what I feel good in. A color could totally look good on me, but I may not have the guts or the feelings to put it on, to wear it outside.</br>
  The colors I own the most of are the colors I feel the most confident in.</br>
  Could the colors that I feel good in be influenced by my biases? Of course! At this point though, is it doing any harm? I'd say probably not. My dream is to have a tailored closet, not a rainbow one. Therefore, I can't own all the colors in the world anyways.</br>
  One way I decide whether I feel more confident in one color v.s. another is to compare them with each other using things that exist in real life.</br>
  For comparing red and orange, I used two fruits that are both round and chubby: apples and oranges.</br>
  Suprisingly, being an apple made me feel great. But thinking of myself as an orange didn't.</br>
  So for me, red > orange.</br></p>
</div>

<div class="someContentBanner">
  <p><b>Practicality</b></br>
  Being practical is about picking colors that I can wear in many occassions. It also means picking colors that I can wear often with minimal stress.</br>
  I live in a large city with lots of traffic and lots of grime. This means chosing bottoms that are dark in color. This means chosing shoes that are durable and don't easily stain.</br>
  This also means that as much as a full, light-color suite or outfit looks amazing, I cannot wear them. It's a little disappointing.</br></p>
</div>

<div class="someContentBanner">
  <p><b>Nemesis Colors</b></br>
  Since I pretty much told you all about my biases in the first few paragraphs, this last part will be about colors that I fall in love with when I see them and can't tell they are horrible until a long, long time later.</br>
  Nemesis colors are like the person you could have in your life that is truly horrible to you in so many ways but acts super super nice and you don't find out until much later. Or perhaps it's like the person who is so obviously horrid but you keep making excuses for them until one day you run out of space and decide they have to go.</br>
  There was no attachement or tears. You don't miss them at all. Then you wonder, why did you even have them in your life?</br>
  Okay, colors are not people.</br>
  But hopefully you get what I mean when I say these colors are my nemesis.</br>
  These colors are so very clever because they look very similar to colors that I love and look good on me. However, these colors, which are just a tad different, do not make the cut.</br></p>

  <p>I need to remember which ones do look good and which ones don't.</br></p>
