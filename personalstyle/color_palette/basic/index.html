  <p><span class="first-letter">I</span> was first introduced to the concept of matching a color to my physical look in my teenage years. Before that, I thought the colors that a person wears depended on its practicality and that individual's thoughts.</p>
</div>
<div class="someContentBanner">
  <p>White meant getting dirty. </p>
  <p>Silver or gold meant they were obsessed with money and looking rich.</p>
  <p>Hot pink meant not only were they super feminine, they were bold and lit up the crowd like: "Look here, here's some hot stuff!"</p>
  <p>Neon colors meant they were like Picasso: highly priced, admired, and hard to understand.</p>
  <p>Any sort of animal print meant they were playing dress-up because they didn't like being a human.</p>
  <p>A full black attire that was fitted meant they wanted to be a ninja. But a full black attire that was not meant they were shrouded in gloom.</p>
</div>

<div class="someContentBanner">
  <p>I've made peace with some of these beliefs. Typically, when we "grow up", we lose some of the weird perceptions we had as a child. We are more conscious of our misconceptions and biases and try to make decisions that are less influenced by them.</p>
  <p>I still feel self-conscious when I purchase something that is in a gold or silver color. It could be stainless steel or rope, but the color throws me off. Isn't that crazy?</p>
  <p>White is still a color I associate with anxiety. I only ever consider white when I'm buying things that go on the upper half of my body--even then, I've owned white t-shirts and they just...are not great. I check them for stains (food, dirt, sweat) constantly and it annoys me. So. Much. I love that a white shirt (collared or no) goes so easily with other colors. I also love how a white collared shirt can usually make me look a bit more put together no matter what. It's so hard to take care of, though.</p>
  <p>Hot pink is a color that I see now as bold and fierce. I love hot pink sports bras and atheletic outerwear.</p>
  <p>Neon colors are also colors that I love now. I would definitely buy sports gear in a neon green. It's also a great color for rain gear or something that I'd want to be wearing when there's low visibility outdoors.  I don't own many in my closet.</p>
  <p>Animal print is still not my thing. It's hard to find in the first place (unless if it's trending that season). I just don't own any and I don't find myself gravitating towards it.</p>
  <p>What about black? Black is hard and picky (I have a hard time finding a piece that I like). But it is so worth it. Usually black hides dirt and grit, which is a plus when moving around in the city.</p>

  <span class="first-letter">Skin Undertone</span> was a label I despised, but it was, and still is, widely used everywhere. Powder? Lipstick? You name it.
  </p>
  <p>To be honest, I always had somewhat have an idea of what my undertone was. I just hated the label.</p>
  <p> The dreaded label of yellow undertone. </p> 
</div>


<div class="someContentBanner">
<p> Why couldn't I be the neutral undertone that gets to wear whatever color they wanted? It's not fair. Such thoughts plagued me in my teen years.  </p>
<p>Moreover, growing up, labeling someone with "yellow skin" was unkind namecalling at best, and discriminatory. It was rude, harmful, and unacceptable. Always. The connotation behind labelling anyone as "yellow undertone" made me uncomfortable.</p>
</div>

<div class="someContentBanner">
<p> I remember going into a makeup store with my friend and watching her swatch lipstick. At one point, she said a particular bottle of foundation would suite me because I was a yellow undertone like her. That day, I learned that the color of my veins (more green instead of blue) decided what skin undertone I was.</p>
<p> But I was not very happy with this result. I wanted to be something else.</p>
<p> When the concept of "olive undertone" came out, I was excited. "Not pink or yellow undertone". "In between". It was fantastically vague and I thought I could make this new label work for me. However, when I got to the colors suggested for an olive undertone, I hated them. I was out.</p>
<p> My friend was right. And later, my mother taught me to look past the label of my skintone.</p>
<p>My mother made it simple: <b>"Warm colors look good on you."</b> And that's when it clicked for me.</p>
<p>Why use skin color as a label? Why not use the actual colors as a label instead?</p>
<p>
It's about finding the right color for yoyourself.</p>
</br>
<p> And that's my takeaway for you. It's about what looks good on you. It doesn't matter what shade or color you are. It has to make you feel special, warm, and lovely.</p>

  <p>Today, I believe that warm colors look good on me. And they do.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Is my closet full of warm colors only?</p>
  <p>Nope! (maybe someday, though?)</p>
</div>

<div class="someContentBanner">
  <p><span class="first-letter">Feeling confident</span> is feeling good. Why buy something that the internet says fits my undertone if I would never wear it?<p>

  <p>This part really comes down to who you are. You have to be honest with yourself. Let's take a look at a Picasso-styled doodle: abstract, warped shaped, and full of different colors. Personally, I detest looking at it because it gives off an unhappy vibe.</p>
  <p>Feeling good in a color is like your taste in art. It's subjective and entirely about you. There is no right or wrong. You could detest a piece of art but acknowledge that it is a masterpiece. It's the same with color.</p>
  <p>You can be more objective by separating the color of the item from its shape and other features. My method is cutting out a phone-sized square hole from cardstock, then looking at the item through the hole. That way, you're seeing just the color and you're not distracted by the its other aspects. Which usually helps me make a better decision. Afterall, one of my pitfalls was making a purchase, only to end up detesting the color after a week.</p>

  <p><span class="first-letter"> Being practical</span> is having clothes that work with my lifestyle.</p>
  <p>
  It's about picking colors that I can wear to many occassions, and colors that I can wear often with minimal stress.
  </p>
  <p>
  I live in a large city with lots of traffic and lots of grime. There are crowds and cars and strong winds from the airflow around skyscrapers. This means chosing outerwear, bottoms, and shoes that are wearable and don't easily stain.</p>
  <p>
  This also means that as much as a full, light-color suite or outfit looks amazing, I cannot wear them. It's a little disappointing.
  Anywho, My dream is to have a tailored closet, not a rainbow one. Therefore, I can't own all the colors in the world anyways</p>
