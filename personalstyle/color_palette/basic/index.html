  <p><span class="first-letter">I</span> was first introduced to the concept of matching a color to my physical look in my teenage years. Before that, I thought the colors that a person wears depended on its practicality and that individual's thoughts.</p>
</div>
<div class="someContentBanner">
  <p>White meant getting dirty. </p>
  <p>Silver or gold meant they were obsessed with money and looking rich.</p>
  <p>Hot pink meant not only were they super feminine, they were bold and lit up the crowd like: "Look here, here's some hot stuff!"</p>
  <p>Neon colors meant they were like Picasso: highly priced, admired, and hard to understand.</p>
  <p>Any sort of animal print meant they were playing dress-up because they didn't like being a human.</p>
  <p>A full black attire that was fitted meant they wanted to be a ninja. But a full black attire that was not meant they were shrouded in gloom.</p>
</div>

<div class="someContentBanner">
  <p>I've made peace with some of these beliefs. Typically, when we "grow up", we lose some of the weird perceptions we had as a child. We are more conscious of our misconceptions and biases and try to make decisions that are less influenced by them.</p>
  <p>I still feel self-conscious when I purchase something that is in a gold or silver color. It could be stainless steel or rope, but the color throws me off. Isn't that crazy?</p>
  <p>White is still a color I associate with anxiety. I only ever consider white when I'm buying things that go on the upper half of my body--even then, I've owned white t-shirts and they just...are not great. I check them for stains (food, dirt, sweat) constantly and it annoys me. So. Much. I love that a white shirt (collared or no) goes so easily with other colors. I also love how a white collared shirt can usually make me look a bit more put together no matter what. It's so hard to take care of, though.</p>
  <p>Hot pink is a color that I see now as bold and fierce. I love hot pink sports bras and atheletic outerwear.</p>
  <p>Neon colors are also colors that I love now. I would definitely buy sports gear in a neon green. It's also a great color for rain gear or something that I'd want to be wearing when there's low visibility outdoors.  I don't own many in my closet.</p>
  <p>Animal print is still not my thing. It's hard to find in the first place (unless if it's trending that season). I just don't own any and I don't find myself gravitating towards it.</p>
  <p>What about black? Black is hard and picky (I have a hard time finding a piece that I like). But it is so worth it. Usually black hides dirt and grit, which is a plus when moving around in the city.</p>

  <p>Now.</p>
</div>

<div class="someContentBanner">
<p>Today, my formula for whether a color fits in my color palette is:</br></br> drumroll please... </br></br>
  <b> [( color goes with my skin tone ) AND ( color makes me feel confident ) AND ( color goes with other items that I wear )] - ( nemesis colors )</b></p>
</div>

<div class="someContentBanner">
  <p><b>Skin Tone</b></p>
  <p>Skin tone is...what my skin is. Is it pink? Is it yellow? Is it grey?</p>
  <p>To be honest, I always had somewhat have an idea of what my skin tone was. I just hated the label.</p>
  <p> The dreaded label of yellow undertone. </p> 
</div>

<div class="someContentBanner">
<p> Why couldn't I be the neutral undertone that gets to wear whatever color they wanted? </p>
<p> It's not fair.</p>
<p> These thoughts plagued me in my teen years.</p>
<p> Moreover, growing up, labeling someone with "yellow skin" was unkind namecalling at best, and discriminatory. It was rude, harmful, and unacceptable. Always. </p>
<p>The connotation behind labelling anyone as "yellow undertone" made me uncomfortable.</p>
</div>

<div class="someContentBanner">
<p> I remember going into a makeup store with my friend and watching her swatch lipstick. At one point, she said a particular bottle of foundation would suite me because I was a yellow undertone like her. That day, I learned that the color of my veins (more green instead of blue) decided what skin undertone I was.</p>
<p> But I was not very happy with this result. I wanted to be something else.</p>
<p> When the concept of "olive undertone" came out, I was excited. "Not pink or yellow undertone". "In between". It was fantastically vague and I thought I could make this new label work for me. However, when I got to the colors suggested for an olive undertone, I hated them. I was out.</p>
<p> My friend was right. And later, my mother taught me to look past the label of my skintone.</p>
<p>My mother made it simple: <b>"Warm colors look good on you."</b></p>
<p>A lightbulb went off in my head.</p>
<p>Why not use groups of colors as a label instead?</p>
<p> I was so happy. I loved, loved that description.</p>
<p>
And the best part was, by saying "the color looks good on me" instead of "I look good in that color", it made it about me finding the right color.</p>
</br>
<p> That's my takeaway for you.</p>
<p>It's about what looks good on you. It doesn't matter what shade or color you are. It has to make you feel special, warm, and lovely.</p>

  <p>Today, I believe that warm colors look good on me. And they do.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Is my closet full of warm colors only?</p>
  <p>Nope! (maybe someday, though?)</p>
</div>

<div class="someContentBanner">
  <p><b>Confidence</b></br>
  Confidence is what I feel good in. A color could totally look good on me, but I may not have the guts or the feelings to put it on, to wear it outside.</br>
  The colors I own the most of are the colors I feel the most confident in.</br>
  Could the colors that I feel good in be influenced by my biases? Of course! At this point though, is it doing any harm? I'd say probably not. My dream is to have a tailored closet, not a rainbow one. Therefore, I can't own all the colors in the world anyways.</br>
  One way I decide whether I feel more confident in one color v.s. another is to compare them with each other using things that exist in real life.</br>
  For comparing red and orange, I used two fruits that are both round and chubby: apples and oranges.</br>
  Suprisingly, being an apple made me feel great. But thinking of myself as an orange didn't.</br>
  So for me, red > orange.</br></p>
</div>

<div class="someContentBanner">
  <p><b>Practicality</b></br>
  Being practical is about picking colors that I can wear in many occassions. It also means picking colors that I can wear often with minimal stress.</br>
  I live in a large city with lots of traffic and lots of grime. This means chosing bottoms that are dark in color. This means chosing shoes that are durable and don't easily stain.</br>
  This also means that as much as a full, light-color suite or outfit looks amazing, I cannot wear them. It's a little disappointing.</br></p>
</div>

<div class="someContentBanner">
  <p><b>Nemesis Colors</b></br>
  Since I pretty much told you all about my biases in the first few paragraphs, this last part will be about colors that I fall in love with when I see them and can't tell they are horrible until a long, long time later.</br>
  Nemesis colors are like the person you could have in your life that is truly horrible to you in so many ways but acts super super nice and you don't find out until much later. Or perhaps it's like the person who is so obviously horrid but you keep making excuses for them until one day you run out of space and decide they have to go.</br>
  There was no attachement or tears. You don't miss them at all. Then you wonder, why did you even have them in your life?</br>
  Okay, colors are not people.</br>
  But hopefully you get what I mean when I say these colors are my nemesis.</br>
  These colors are so very clever because they look very similar to colors that I love and look good on me. However, these colors, which are just a tad different, do not make the cut.</br></p>

  <p>I need to remember which ones do look good and which ones don't.</br></p>
