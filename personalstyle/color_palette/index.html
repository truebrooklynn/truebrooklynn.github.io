  <p><span class="first-letter">I</span>n my teenage years, I was introduced to the concept of wearing colors based on the tones in my physical appearance.
    Before that, I wore only my favorite colors.</p>
</div>
<div class="someContentBanner">
  <p>Thoughts I had as a child:</p>
  <p>
    White = you were afraid of getting dirty. </br>
    Silver/gold = you wanted to look rich.</br>
    Hot pink = "Look here, here's some hot stuff!"</br>
    Neon colors = you were like Picasso: highly priced, admired, and hard to understand.</br>
    Any sort of animal print =  playing dress-up because you didn't like being a human.</br>
    A full black attire = (fitted) ninja, (voluminous) scary.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="someContentBanner">
  <p>
    I've made peace with some of these beliefs. As I "grew up", I lost some of the weird perceptions we had as a child.
    I've become more conscious of my misconceptions and biases, their influences from the media.
    I still feel self-conscious when I purchase something that is in a gold or silver color. 
    I stay away from white bottoms. White in general still makes me stressed when I wear it. 
    I love that a white shirt/bottom/skirt pairs so easily with other colors. 
    However, I'm prone to stains from food, dirt, sweat. Having to be extra careful distracts me from other tasks I'm doing through the day. 
    Hot pink is a color that I see now as bold and fierce. 
    I love hot pink sports bras and atheletic outerwear, but they, and other neon colors in general, tend to bleed when I sweat or in the wash.
    Nevertheless, neon is great to wear when there's low visibility outdoors.  I don't own many in my closet.
    Animal print is still not my thing. It's hard to find in the first place (unless if it's trending that season). 
    I just don't own any and I don't find myself gravitating towards it.
  </p>
  <p>
    What about black? Black is hard and picky (I have a hard time finding a piece that I like). 
    But it is so worth it. Usually black hides dirt and grit, which is a plus when moving around in the city.

    Skin Undertone is a label I despise, but it's used everywhere.
    Makeup blogs, beauty quizzes, outfit colors, ... they all use skin undertone as the key to what you should put on.
    To be honest, I always had somewhat of an idea of my undertone. 
    I was just in denial because I hated the label.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yellow.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yellow is an extremely rude way of describing someone.
    In a similar manner, using a racially offensive term to depict someone's appearance is rude, discriminatory, and unacceptable.
    Skin color labels have historically been used to insult and cause harm, and it's still being used today.
    The connotation behind labelling anyone as "yellow undertone" makes me uncomfortable.
  </p>

  <p> 
    Pink was fine; it's uncommon to use pink to depict someone's skin in a racially discriminatory way -- however, my undertone was not pink.
  </p>
  <p>
    I remember going into a makeup store with my friend and watching her swatch lipstick. 
    At one point, she said a particular bottle of foundation would suite me because I was a yellow undertone like her. 
    The color of my veins, more green than of blue, decided that my skin undertone yellow.
    But I was not happy with this conclusion. Yellow skin was such a horrid way of describing anyone.
    I wanted to be called something else.
  </p>
  <p> 
    When the concept of "olive undertone" came out, I was excited.
    The label olive, to me, was fairly neutral. Like pink, it's uncommon to hear the word "olive" in racist phrases.
    Olive was supposedly not pink nor yellow, but "in between", whatever that meant. 
    It was fantastically vague and I thought I could make this new label work for me.
    However, when I got to the recommended colors section for the olive undertone, I was out.
  </p>
  <p>In the end... my friend was right about my undertone.
    And later, I learned to look past the label of my skintone, and appreciate it for what it was.

  <p style="text-align:center"><span class="first-letter"><b>"Warm colors look good on you."</b></span></p>
  <p>Something clicked into place when I heard this comment. Why use skin color as a label? Why not use the actual colors as a label instead?
     At the end of the day, it's about finding the right color for me. And that was my takeaway.
     Regardless of skin color, it's about what looks good. It has to make you feel special, warm, and lovely.</p>

  <p>Today, I say that warm colors look good on me. And they do.</p>
  <p>Is my closet full of warm colors only? Not at all! Maybe someday?</p>

    Feel confident, not confused.
  </span></p>
  <p>
    I have to feel comfortable in my skin. Why buy something that the internet says fits my undertone if I would never wear it?
    This part gets real personal.
    It takes a lot of honest judgement inwards.
    If you don't know what you're expressing with the colors you wear, if you don't think the colors suit who you are, well... 
    The reflection in the mirror will confuse not only you, but your audience as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    For instance, let's take a look at a Picasso-styled doodle.
    It's abstract, warped shaped, and full of different colors. 
    It's busy and loud.
    Personally, I detest looking at it.
    In my eyes, it has no focus, no direction, and it's scattered everywhere.
    It gives off a lost, unhappy vibe.

    You might disagree, and that's normal. Feeling good in a color is like your taste in art. 
    It's subjective and entirely about you. There is no right or wrong.
    You could detest a piece of art but acknowledge that it is a masterpiece. It's the same with color.</p>
  <p>
    You can recognize that a color looks great on someone, but hate wearing it yourself.
    The key is being conscious of what colors you will and will not wear. It saves wasteful purchases.
    You could try to be more objective when evaluating a piece by separating the color of the item from its shape and other features. 
    My method is cutting out a phone-sized square hole from cardstock, then looking at the item through the hole.
    That way, I'm seeing just the color and I'm not distracted by the its other aspects of the piece when I'm trying to decide if it will be a good addition to my closet.
    Which usually helps me make a better decision. Afterall, one of my pitfalls was making a purchase, only to end up detesting the color after a week.</p>

  <p><span class="first-letter">Have colors that work with my lifestyle</span></p>
  <p>
    Some of you here may not like to be practical. You may feel it stifles your creativity.
    You can't escape the fact that there are certain colors that just aren't appropriate for certain activities.
    For example, an orange pair of slacks to work is going to make a statement. A white t-shirt while gardening will get visibly soiled.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I assessed the colors for my palette, I considered picking colors that I can wear to many occassions, easily coordinate, 
    and colors that I can wear often with minimal stress.
    I live in a large city with lots of traffic and lots of grime. There are crowds and cars and strong winds from the airflow around skyscrapers. 
    This means chosing outerwear, bottoms, and shoes that are wearable and don't easily stain.
  </p>
  <p>
    This also means that as much as a full, light-color suite or outfit looks amazing, I cannot wear them. It's a little disappointing.
    Anywho, My dream is to have a tailored closet, not a rainbow one. Therefore, I can't own all the colors in the world anyways

  </br>Sticking to my color palette helps me maintain a cohesive wardrobe. It's easier to put together matching outfits that I want to wear. 
  Not every piece of clothing I wear follows these rules. I try my best!</p>
  <p>Each piece of clothing needs to be worn, I absolutely dislike having things sit there collecting dust.
     Making good use of my money is important to me; cross-checking with my palette helps me ground the spontaneous energy I get when I walk past a clothing store.</p>
