          <p>Following a plan and a budget helps maximize long-term cohesiveness. 
            It keeps my possessions a reusable and organized nature. They work as a team.
            This saves me from potentially wasting money, time, and effort on buying the
            same things more than once, or something that is completely incompatible
            with everything else I already own.

            Wearing expensive clothes does not make you fashionable.

            Each purchase and item I spend on are not intended to be a final outfit themselves,
            but rather the building blocks for later, and multiple, outfits. Minimizing 
            owning unnecessary duplicates avoids wasting storage space, which is costly.
            Finally, there is no embarrassment in thrifting, nor in using or wearing non-brand
            named clothes.

              A wish list for mapping out things you want to provide help separating impulse purchases
              and what goals are worthy to pursue and the appropriate method to do so (thrift, DIY, buy).
