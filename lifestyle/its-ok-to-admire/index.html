    We shouldn't feel bad or guilty for wanting. In fact, admiration fuels self-discovery, creativity, and knowledge-seeking.
  </p>
  <p>
    The things I feel drawn to have a connection with my internal state of emotions. When I see something I like, I jot it down or pin it, saving
    the datapoint for later. Then, I will go back to my board after a while and observe all the items I listed down. I try to find a pattern. Often it is difficult
    for me to articulate my desires or thoughts precisely. Seeing a collection of my interests throughout a period helps me pinpoint the thoughts and feelings that
    are floating in my subconsciousness. Then, I learn a little more about myself and where I currently am at.

    Seeing new things and new perspectives inspires me. It makes me think of new things I want to try, different things I want to do. Seeing a cool outfit
    gives me ideas of how I could coordinate clothes. They break down these invisible walls of "impossible" into "let's try it.
    How do I do that?
    I never knew people could do it like this.
    How do I make it work for me?
  </p>
  <p>
    Don't be scared of discovering new things. Have courage to try-on new things. The easiest place to do so is in the dressing room :)
