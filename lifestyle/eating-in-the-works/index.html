		<span class="first-letter">I</span> am a firm believer of "you are what you eat", "calories in, calories out" 
    and that eating street food / eating out in general is neither healthy nor sustainable. 
    I've lost count of the number of times I spent money on food or eating out, only to not like what I ordered.
    May I emphasize that these are my BELIEFS for my habits. How I recommend finding your own values and preferences in food
    -- your style, if you will, then sticking to it.

      Health Reasons (Doctor's Orders)
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    X candy
    X deep fried foods, heavily oiled foods
    X fries / chips / icecream*
    X BBQ*
  </p>
  <p>
    * I told my doctor I don't think I can cut out ice cream and BBQ entirely.. she sighed and said then TRY to minimize it.
    So basically I'm not supposed to have it but I can once in a while... My doctor is probably so done with me LOL.
    I'M TRYING...
