		I am a firm believer of "you are what you eat". I also believe in "calories in, calories out" discipline as 
    overconsumption not only adds uncomfortable bloating for me, but also adds unnecessary stress. Hence, I try
    to limit snacking and consuming food cooked outside (especially fried foods) as it is unsustainable for me. 
    Although I do not think of myself as a good cook, I've lost count of the number of times I spent money on food
    outside, only to think of it as a waste later because I did not like the food and could have made it taste better
    for me, had I cooked it myself.

    My top personal goals related to food are to limit my sugar and sodium intake and limit my fried food consumption
    with the hope to completely stop eating fried food on day. 
    My key cooking appliances are: a rice cooker, a stovetop and oven, an air fryer, and a smoothie blender.
    My key food preparation tools are: a chopper and board, a grater, a garlic press, and a vegetable peeler.

    I'm sharing my daily and weekly targets to stay on track for my goals. I would like to emphasize that these are 
    my personal beliefs and these continue to change. I would recommend others to identify their own values and preferences 
    and then sticking to it.
