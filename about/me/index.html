<div class="someContentBanner">
	  <p>Welcome! I'm Brooke, a creative soul navigating life in my twenties.
	  Currently, I'm working on a sustainable and cohesive wardrobe of practices 
	  where everything in life fits seamlessly together and each and every one
	  receives dedicated use and love.

			  <i>More About My Journey</i>
		  </summary>
		  <div class="detailsContentGrey">
			  <p>I strive to curate a timeless collection while minimizing purchases.
				My interest started in a chatter-filled room, sketching cartoon characters.
				This transitioned to re-creating pieces to wear and decorate my space, then
				grew to reusing, repurposing, and restyling items for customization and
				self-expression.
			  </p>
			  <p>
				To describe my style in short: clean, cute, and cozy. I bring enthusiasm to 
				changing seasons and trends. I am fun-loving, creative, and open-minded. I 
				am comfortable being my own self that I can refuse trends I don't like
				and self-conscious to ask others if I am dressed right for the occasion.
			  </p>
			  <p>
				In my free time, I enjoy walks in the outdoors. The world around me inspires
				to write prose and poetry. I also love to draw, make crafts, and paint.
				My favorite subjects of art are animals and people.

	  <p>
		I believe style is expressed in all aspects of life: dress, habits, living spaces, and more. 
		</p>
		<p>
		  This website a place for journaling my process of building my style, personal introspection, and potentially
		  inspiring others to find their own style.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  Lots of hugs,
	  </p>
