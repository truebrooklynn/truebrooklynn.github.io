  <p>I am Brooklynn, and I'm sharing my practices in personal style. I strive to curate my timeless closet without constantly buying new items. My interest in fashion began in my childhood years, where I started drawing made-up characters and designing characters. I gradually moved towards creating decor for my room and customizing bags and sneakers to hide logos and add pizzazz. I believe that style is expressed not only in the way I dress, but also aspects in life including eating habits, active living, travel, and organization. I am fun-loving, creative, and open-minded. I reuse, repurpose, and restyle items I have and approach changing seasons and trends with enthusiasm. Currently, I am working towards a sustainable, cohesive wardrobe and lifestyle, where everything fits seamlessly together and every item I own receives dedicated use and love.</p>
  <p>To describe my personal style in three words: clean, cute, cozy. I am confident enough to not conform to trends I don't like, self-conscious enough to want to be dressed right for the occassion. This is a place for quiet introspection and recording my journey. I hope you find this entertaining and helpful for finding your own style!</p>
  <p>XOXO</p>
