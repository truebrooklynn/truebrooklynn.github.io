            Anywhere between enough to last you until the next laundry load,
            and able to fit neatly into your closet. Remember: owning more things does not make you more fashionable!
            It's about how they work together.

        I love fashion and I love buying new things - help!

            Think about what you have in your closet. Ask yourself:
            do I already own this? Can you repurpose items you
            already have to meet my needs?
          </p>

            Remmeber: just because it looks attractive on the hanger,
            doesn't mean it will have the same effect draped on you
            if you buy it.
            Most of us don't look like mannequins. I for one, am always
            shorter and bigger than them, so cute pants and skirts
            don't always have the same shape, or end at the same spot,
            as it does on the hanger. It changes the whole look.

        How do I know what colors go well with this item?

      <div class="detailsContent">
          <p>
            For matching, "put-together" looks, consider: 
            using the exact same color, using the same 
            hue but different shade, or if it's a pattern or print: 
            wear things that are the same as one color in the print.
          </p>
          <p>
            For contrasting or casual looks, consider:
            wearing something in a much darker or much lighter shade,
            wearing shomething in a neighboring color on the color wheel,
            or picking something opposite on the color wheel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tip: check the dress code - 
            especially if you're attending a wedding or similar event. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Tip: Know what color combinations bothers you! For example, 
            I dislike outfits with the "complementary colors" of the color wheel; 
            I absolutely abhor the combination of orange on top of blue, purple with yellow, red directly beside green.
            Avoid dressing in ways you don't like!
          </p>
          <p>
            Tip: too busy, too much? Work magic by adding neutrals. Sometimes colors look better in an outfit when they're separated by a color like white, beige, grey, or black.

            Wearing expensive clothes everyday does not make you fashionable!
            Stick to your budget.
          </p>

            Try before you buy and look closely at the item.
            Returning can be a hassle - beware of returning / postage fees.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shop from reputable stores, stores that are well known amongst friends and residents. This goes with my previous point - know the store's policies, especially on exchanges and returns.
            Be realistic: know the price ranges for the item you are looking for. 
            If it's too much, save up for it and, in the meantime, consider
            if it will really be a worthy purchase.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your goal is to reduce your consumption,
            minimize time spent at stores, including online stores.

        How do I shop more sustainably?

            Remember: buying new should be your the last resort.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sort out your inventory. Do you already have it? Consider alternatives with what you already own. You don't have it? Consider borrowing or renting from a friend or DIY with recycled or unwanted items.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shop second hand. Reuse where you can!
          </p>
          <p>
            Set goals: for example, I can only make 5-10 new purchases a year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, Really love what you buy and use it!
